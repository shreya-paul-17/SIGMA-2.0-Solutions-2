5.  List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth

Ans: Database Management Systems (DBMS) can be classified based on various criteria such as data models, structure, or the number of users it supports. Here, we will focus on the classification based on data models, which is one of the most fundamental aspects of database systems. Here are the primary types:

1. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):
    Description: In RDBMS, data is organized in tables (relations), which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific type of entity, and rows in a table represent instances of that entity. Columns represent attributes of the entity, and each row/column intersection stores a single data value.

    Key Features:
    1. Data is accessed and modified using a query language, typically SQL (Structured Query Language).
    2. Provides strong data integrity through the use of primary and foreign keys.
    3. Supports powerful operations like joins, which link data from multiple tables based on related column values.

    Examples: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL.

2. NoSQL Database Management System:
    Description: NoSQL databases are designed to handle a wide variety of data models, including document, graph, key-value, and wide-column stores. They are often used for large sets of distributed data.

    Key Features:
    1. Highly scalable and designed for large data volumes.
    2. Flexible schema design, which allows for easy changes to the data model.
    3. Typically not using SQL as a query language, hence the name "NoSQL" (Not Only SQL).

    Sub-types:
    1. Document Stores: Data is stored in document formats (e.g., JSON, XML). Example: MongoDB, CouchDB.
    2. Graph Databases: Optimized for storing and querying data in terms of entities and relationships, which are represented as graphs. Example: Neo4j, ArangoDB.
    3. Key-Value Stores: Data is stored in an array of key-value pairs. Example: Redis, DynamoDB.
    4. Wide-Column Stores: Stores data tables as columns rather than rows, useful for queries over large datasets. Example: Cassandra, HBase.

    Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j.

3. Hierarchical Database Management System:
    Description: Data is structured in a tree-like model, using parent/child relationships. Each parent can have multiple children, but each child has only one parent.

    Key Features:
    1. Data retrieval is straightforward and fast using a simple tree traversal.
    2. Mainly used where data is naturally hierarchical, such as organizational structures or file systems.

    Examples: IBM Information Management System (IMS).

4. Network Database Management System:
    Description: Similar to hierarchical databases but with more complex relationships. In network databases, each child can have multiple parents, allowing more complex relational models.

    Key Features:
    1. Supports many-to-many relationships.
    2. More flexible than hierarchical databases but can be more complex to design and manage.

    Examples: Integrated Data Store (IDS), Raima Database Manager.

5. Object-Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS):
    Description: Data is stored in the form of objects, as used in object-oriented programming.

    Key Features:
    1. Supports the storage of more complex data types like objects directly.
    2. Objects can be directly stored without conversion or mapping, maintaining the integrity of object data models and facilitating data retrieval.

    Examples: ObjectDB, db4o.
